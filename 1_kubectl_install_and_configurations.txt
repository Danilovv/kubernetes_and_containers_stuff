#
SETUP MINIKUBE_HOME env variable first, if you dont want to store virtual drive and other vm stuff in your home directory.
#
INSTALL minikube into hyper-v VM.
Setup 8 cores, 12Gb of memory and 50Gb of storage for VM.
Switch name = my manual created switch, which has an access to host machine networ.
minikube start --driver='hyperv' --cpus=8 --memory='12g' --disk-size='50g' --hyperv-virtual-switch='Net_1'
#
DELETE existing VM with kubernetes (u will love it)
kubectl delete
